# Grey Silence

[Insert evil overlord]'s turrets have stolen the sound and colour from this endless runner world! Keep collecting gems to bring them back - hit a turret and you'll die though.

## Getting Started

I wasn't able to get round to the audio ðŸ˜… But the colour works. Basically the longer you run/the higher you score, the more colour comes back into the world.
